# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! Follow these rules:
- Keep solutions and walkthroughs out of `main`. Use a protected branch for solutions.
- Add new vulnerabilities as isolated modules and include LABS and MITIGATIONS.
- Never add content that encourages illegal activity — labs must be safe and for authorized use only.
- Follow the repo's code style and tests.
